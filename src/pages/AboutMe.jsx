              I'm Deborah Russell-A, an SEO Content Writer with three years of
              experience in the writing industry. I developed an interest in writing
              in secondary school but took it as a hobby.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">
              A few months after graduation, I took a Digital Marketing certification
              course by Side Hustle (now Terra Learning). I learned about SEO and
              decided to give it a try.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">
              Within the past few years, I have successfully written articles that
              ranked on Googleâ€™s first page for specific keywords in the SaaS
              industry.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 text-lg">I can help you achieve this too!</p>
